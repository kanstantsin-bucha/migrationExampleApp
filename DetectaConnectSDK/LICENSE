Payment

Scope

The Licensed Contributions are the contributions the Developer has made to the Project with the Offer Identifier in metadata, as well as any contributions the Developer makes to the Project in the future without changing the Offer Identifier or adding a new one. Licensed Contributions do not include any contributions the Developer makes to the project in the future with a different or additional identifier.

Copyright

The Developer licenses the User for the Term to do everything with the Licensed Contributions that would otherwise infringe the Developer's copyright in them.

Patent

The Developer licenses the User for the Term to do everything with the Project that would otherwise infringe patent claims the Developer can license or becomes able to license.

Sublicensing

If the User combines some or all of the Licensed Contributions with other software in a larger application, the User may pass on their license rights, or sublicense, those Licensed Contributions as part of their larger application, and allow further sublicensing in turn, under the following rules:

Value

The larger application must have significant additional content or functionality beyond that of the Project, and end users must license the larger application primarily for that added content or functionality.

Maintenance

The User may sublicense others to maintain the larger application, but not to use the Licensed Contributions in new or different ways in that application, or to develop larger applications of their own.

Purpose

The purpose of Value and Maintenance is to prevent the User from sublicensing others who should buy their own private licenses.

Terms

Sublicensing and Notices, as well as warranty disclaimers and damages exclusions at least as broad as Disclaimer and Exclusion, must apply to each sublicense.

Unlimited Applications

The User may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as they like.

Notices

In order to make sure that everyone who gets a copy of the Licensed Contributions knows about the license terms for their use, the Developer agrees to give everyone who gets a copy of some or all of the Licensed Contributions from them, with or without changes, the text of this license and any public license for the Licensed Contributions.

Agency

The Developer has authorized the Agent to sign this license on the Developer's behalf. The Agent is not a party to this license.

Guarantee

The Developer guarantees that they either own or have the rights to license copyrights in the Licensed Contributions, and are aware that legal rules and agreements can make others the owners of copyrights in their work.

Disclaimer

With the sole exception of Guarantee, as far as the law allows, the Project comes as is, without any warranty or condition.

Exclusion

With the sole exception of Guarantee, as far as the law allows, neither the Developer nor their Agent will be liable to anyone for any damages related to the Project or this license, under any kind of legal claim.
